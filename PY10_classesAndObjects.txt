The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for assigning values in a class.
class NumberHolder:
    def __init__(self, number): 
      self.number = number

    def returnNumber(self):
       return self.number  

var = NumberHolder(7)
print(var.returnNumber()) #Prints '7'



1). What is __init__?

__init__ is a special method (often called a constructor).
Python automatically calls it when you create a new object from a class.

    var = NumberHolder(7)

is what triggers __init__.

2). What does self mean?

self refers to the specific object being created.

When Python runs:

    NumberHolder(7)

it internally does something like:

    __init__(self=var, number=7)

So:

@ self → the new NumberHolder object (var)

@ number → the argument 7

3). What does self.number = number do?

This line:
  
    self.number = number

means:

“Store the value 7 inside this object under the name number.”

After __init__ runs, the object looks like this:

    var.number == 7

So number becomes an instance variable (data that belongs to that object).


4). What does returnNumber() do?

    def returnNumber(self):
    return self.number

This method:

@ accesses the object’s stored value (self.number)

@ returns it

When you call:

    var.returnNumber()

Python automatically passes var as self.

So it returns:

    7

5). Why does it print 7?

Putting it all together:

    var = NumberHolder(7)      # creates object, stores 7 in var.number
    print(var.returnNumber()) # returns var.number → 7

That’s why the output is:
     7
