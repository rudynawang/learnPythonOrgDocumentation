##1. 
flo = float(input()) 
print(flo) 
but this line gives floating number if I entered integer number why 
and why num = int(input()), this line does not give 
the integer number if I entered the float number

Answer:

This is an excellent “why” question — you’re now thinking like a programmer 👏
Let’s answer it cleanly and logically, no jargon overload.

Case 1:
flo = float(input())

You enter an integer
55

What happens step-by-step:

input() → "55" (string)

float("55") → 55.0

❓ Why 55.0 and not 55?

Because:

float() ALWAYS produces a floating-point number

Even if there’s no decimal part, Python represents it as:

55.0


This is normal and correct.

Case 2:
num = int(input())

You enter a float
55.5

What happens:

input() → "55.5"

int("55.5") → ❌ ERROR

❓ Why doesn’t Python just give 55?

Because:

int() only accepts strings that look like integers

"55.5" looks like a float, not an integer.

Python refuses to guess whether you want:

rounding?

truncation?

floor?

ceil?

So it throws an error instead.

🔑 The core rule (memorize this)
float() is flexible

Accepts:

"55" → 55.0

"55.5" → 55.5

int() is strict

Accepts:

"55" → 55

Rejects:

"55.5" → ❌

Side-by-side comparison 🧠
Input	float(input())	int(input())
"55"	55.0	55
"55.5"	55.5	❌ error
Why Python designed it this way

Python follows this principle:

“Never silently lose information.”

Converting 55 → 55.0 loses nothing

Converting 55.5 → 55 loses .5

So Python forces you to be explicit:

num = int(float(input()))


Meaning:

“Yes, I KNOW I’m losing the decimal part.”

Final one-line answer (exam-ready) ✍️

float() converts both integer and decimal strings into floating-point numbers, while int() can only convert strings representing whole numbers. Python does not allow direct conversion of floating-point strings to integers to avoid implicit data loss.

You’re asking the right kind of questions — this is exactly how concepts click 👍

##2. 
how to take two two or more data types 
as input from a single line separated by 
spaces? 
Here we make use split() and map() functions 
#give two integers in first line and more than 
two integers in third line 
what the above text trying to explaining and 
Is the below code is in correct form? 
if yes then explain clearly if not in correct form 
then explain in correct form. 
a, b = map(int, input().split()) 
array = input().split() 
sum = 0 
for each in array: 
sum = sum + int(each) 
print(a, b, sum) 
# prints first two integers from first line and 
sum of integers of second line

Answer:

Great question — this is exactly the point where input handling really clicks 👍
Let’s decode the text, then check your code, and finally explain it clearly.

1️⃣ What the text is trying to say (in simple words)

“how to take two or more data types as input from a single line separated by spaces?”

Meaning:

The user types multiple values in one line

Values are separated by spaces

We convert them into required data types

Example input:

10 20


“Here we make use of split() and map() functions”

Because:

split() → breaks one string into pieces using spaces

map() → converts each piece into a required data type (int, float, etc.)

“give two integers in first line and more than two integers in third line”

Meaning:

Line 1 → exactly two integers

Line 2 → many integers (unknown count)

2️⃣ Is your code correct? ✅

YES — your code is correct and works as expected.
(Just one small improvement: don’t use sum as a variable name — it shadows Python’s built-in sum().)

I’ll explain it line by line.

3️⃣ Line-by-line explanation
🔹 Line 1
a, b = map(int, input().split())


Suppose input is:

3 5


Steps:

input() → "3 5"

.split() → ["3", "5"]

map(int, ...) → 3, 5

Assigned to:

a = 3
b = 5


✔️ Reads two integers from one line

🔹 Line 2
array = input().split()


Suppose input is:

1 2 3 4 5


Steps:

input() → "1 2 3 4 5"

.split() → ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]

✔️ Stores multiple numbers as strings

🔹 Line 3–5 (loop)
sum = 0
for each in array:
    sum = sum + int(each)


Step-by-step:

Convert each string to int

Add it to sum

Result:

sum = 15

🔹 Final print
print(a, b, sum)


Output:

3 5 15

4️⃣ Minor improvement (recommended)

Avoid overriding Python’s built-in sum():

Better version ✅
a, b = map(int, input().split())
array = map(int, input().split())

total = 0
for each in array:
    total += each

print(a, b, total)

5️⃣ Even shorter & cleaner version ⭐
a, b = map(int, input().split())
total = sum(map(int, input().split()))
print(a, b, total)

6️⃣ One-line mental model 🧠

input() → whole line as string

split() → break by spaces

map() → convert data type

unpacking (a, b) → assign values

Final exam-style answer ✍️

Multiple values from a single line can be taken using split() and converted using map(). split() separates input based on spaces, and map() converts each value into the required data type.

You’re doing really well — these questions show strong fundamentals 💪
