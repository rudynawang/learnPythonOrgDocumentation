flo = float(input()) 
print(flo) 
but this line gives floating number if I entered integer number why 
and why num = int(input()), this line does not give 
the integer number if I entered the float number

This is an excellent “why” question — you’re now thinking like a programmer 👏
Let’s answer it cleanly and logically, no jargon overload.

Case 1:
flo = float(input())

You enter an integer
55

What happens step-by-step:

input() → "55" (string)

float("55") → 55.0

❓ Why 55.0 and not 55?

Because:

float() ALWAYS produces a floating-point number

Even if there’s no decimal part, Python represents it as:

55.0


This is normal and correct.

Case 2:
num = int(input())

You enter a float
55.5

What happens:

input() → "55.5"

int("55.5") → ❌ ERROR

❓ Why doesn’t Python just give 55?

Because:

int() only accepts strings that look like integers

"55.5" looks like a float, not an integer.

Python refuses to guess whether you want:

rounding?

truncation?

floor?

ceil?

So it throws an error instead.

🔑 The core rule (memorize this)
float() is flexible

Accepts:

"55" → 55.0

"55.5" → 55.5

int() is strict

Accepts:

"55" → 55

Rejects:

"55.5" → ❌

Side-by-side comparison 🧠
Input	float(input())	int(input())
"55"	55.0	55
"55.5"	55.5	❌ error
Why Python designed it this way

Python follows this principle:

“Never silently lose information.”

Converting 55 → 55.0 loses nothing

Converting 55.5 → 55 loses .5

So Python forces you to be explicit:

num = int(float(input()))


Meaning:

“Yes, I KNOW I’m losing the decimal part.”

Final one-line answer (exam-ready) ✍️

float() converts both integer and decimal strings into floating-point numbers, while int() can only convert strings representing whole numbers. Python does not allow direct conversion of floating-point strings to integers to avoid implicit data loss.

You’re asking the right kind of questions — this is exactly how concepts click 👍
