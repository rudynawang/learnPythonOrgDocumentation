1)) I didn't understood
No worries at all — this is very normal 🙂
Let me explain it in the simplest possible way, no fancy terms.

Think of your Python file as a TV remote

The code in the file is the buttons.
But the TV should turn on only when you press the power button, not when you just pick up the remote.

Now look at this line again:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

What it is REALLY saying:

👉 “Only start the program if THIS file is the one being run.”

Two situations (this is the key 🔑)
✅ Situation 1: You run the file directly

You do:

python game.py


Python thinks:

“Yes, this is the main file.”

So it runs:

main()


✔ Your program starts

❌ Situation 2: The file is used by another file

Another file does:

import game


Python thinks:

“No, this file is just being used, not run.”

So it does NOT run:

main()


✔ Only the functions are loaded, nothing starts automatically

One super-simple sentence (remember this):

🧠 This line stops the program from running when the file is imported.

Tiny example (very clear)
file1.py
def hello():
    print("Hello")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()

file2.py
import file1

What happens?

Run file1.py → prints Hello

Run file2.py → prints nothing

Why?
Because file1.py was imported, not run directly.


2)) then how the file2.py runs the file1.py functions 
Ahhh — this is the missing piece. Good question 👍
Let’s clear it up very simply.

Key idea (most important line):

👉 file2.py does NOT run file1.py automatically.
👉 It only uses its functions when you call them.

Example again (simple)
file1.py
def hello():
    print("Hello")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()

file2.py
import file1

file1.hello()

What happens step by step
1️⃣ You run file2.py
python file2.py


Python:

Loads file1.py

Reads its functions

Does NOT run this part:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()


Because file1.py is being imported, not run.

2️⃣ How does hello() run then?

This line in file2.py:

file1.hello()


👉 This explicitly calls the function.

So now:

Hello


is printed.

Very important rule to remember 🧠

import file1 → loads the code

file1.hello() → runs the function

Importing ≠ running

Real-life analogy 📦

file1.py = a toolbox

file2.py = a worker

import file1 = opening the toolbox
file1.hello() = using a tool

One-line summary (crystal clear)

file2.py runs functions from file1.py only when it calls them using file1.function_name().


3.))  main script's namespace means

First: what is a namespace?

A namespace is simply:

👉 a place where names are stored and looked up

Names like:

variables

functions

classes

imported objects

Think of it as a dictionary of names → objects.


What is the main script?

The main script is:
👉 the Python file you are running directly

Example:
python game.py

Here, game.py is the main script.

So what does “main script’s namespace” mean?

It means:

👉 all the names that are directly available inside the file you are running

Example without import
game.py
x = 10

def hello():
    print("Hi")


Here, the main script’s namespace contains:

x

hello

You can use them directly:
hello()
print(x)

Example with module import
draw.py 
def draw_game():
    print("Drawing game")


game.py
from draw import draw_game

Now the main script’s namespace contains:

draw_game

So you can write:
draw_game()

You do not need:
draw.draw_game()

Because draw_game is already in the main script’s namespace.

Compare with this import
import draw

Now the main script’s namespace contains:

draw

So you must write:
draw.draw_game()

One-line summary (remember this)

🧠 The main script’s namespace is the set of names you can use directly in the file that is being run.


3)) Module initialization The first time a module is loaded into a 
running Python script, it is initialized by executing the code in the 
module once. If another module in your code imports the same module 
again, it will not be loaded again, so local variables inside the 
module act as a "singleton," meaning they are initialized only once.

You can then use this to initialize objects. For example:

# draw.py

def draw_game():
    # when clearing the screen we can use the main screen object initialized in this module
    clear_screen(main_screen)
    ...

def clear_screen(screen):
    ...

class Screen():
    ...

# initialize main_screen as a singleton
main_screen = Screen()
